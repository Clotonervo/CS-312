# CS-312
#### Course Description ####
We will study several general approaches to algorithm design, including Divide and Conquer, Graph-based, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, Intelligent Search, as well as *briefly* treat some advanced topics. We will discuss canonical problems, abstraction and reduction as tools for problem solving, and we will also consider how to tell if an algorithm is correct and how to analyze it's complexity.

#### Projects ####
There will be 5 individual programming projects throughout the semester and one final group project. For each project, you will solve a concrete problem by implementing an algorithm in such a way as to meet a conservative performance requirement. A reasonable implementation will sail through the performance requirement. You will prepare a typed report electronically according to the guidelines for each project. You will answer questions posed in the project guidelines and usually report the results of an empirical analysis of your algorithm. All project reports should include a copy of your documented source code and a screenshot demonstrating the working algorithm. Each project except the last project will include an initial "design experience" to encourage you to think before you code.
