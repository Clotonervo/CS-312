• Analyzing algorithms
	o correctness, complexity, can we do better?
• Asymptotic Analysis
	o BigO, BigΘ, and BigΩ
• Basic arithmetic algorithms and complexity
	o Addition, multiplication, modular arithmetic, modular exponentiation, modular inverse/division, Euclid’s GCD
• Primality testing
	o Fermat’s little theorem, probabilistic nature
	- Probability: each run is 1/2 probabibiliy of being incorrect, total 1-1/2^k for probability of being correct

def run_fermat(N,k):        # Runs in O(n^3) time, but O(n) space
    for number in range(k):
        a = random.randint(2, N-1) 
        if mod_exp(a, N-1, N) == 1: 
            continue
        else:   
            return 'composite'
    return 'prime'

def mod_exp(x, y, N):   # Runs in O(n^3), assuming we have n bits for input, O(n) space
    if y == 0:      
        return 1
    z = mod_exp(x, y//2, N)
    if y % 2 == 0:     
        return (z**2) % N   
    else:
        return x * (z**2) % N  

• Divide and Conquer
	o Paradigm/How is speed up attained, 
	- mergesort O(nlogn)
	- quicksort O(logn) 
	- multiply = divide and conquer, 
	- matrix multiply, 
	- convex hull O(nlogn)
	- selection (median)
• Master Theorem
	o How to use it, what does it tell us, geometric series intuition
• Graph connectedness
	o Graph representation, Depth First Search, search tree and pre/post order values, cycle-detection, DAGs, linearization, finding strongly connected components
• Graph paths
	o Breadth First Search, Dijkstra’s algorithm, priority queue implementations/complexity, negative edges, Bellman-Ford, shortest DAG paths
• Greedy algorithms
	o Paradigm/philosophy, Minimum Spanning Tree with Kruskal’s/Prim’s


Other notes:
	- Figure out how to encode a string in RSA, Look at that a lot more
	- Know complexity of a majority of algorithms: 
		- Dijkstras: O(2V) but with min-priority queue it can be O(V + ElogV)
		- Primms: O((V+E)logV)
RSA:
	j = private key
	(n, k) = public key
	calculate n = p * q
	calculate z = ( p - 1 ) * ( q - 1 )
 	choose a prime number k, such that k is co-prime to z, i.e, z is not divisible by k
 	k * j = 1 ( mod z ) is how you get private key

 Encryption:
 	P^k = E (mod N), where P is the message, N,k are public keys, and E is the encrypted message

 Decryption:
 	E^j = P (mod N), where P is the message, N,k are public keys, E is encrypted message, and j is private key
